# Support

Please be aware that bc2adls is an experimental prototype which is not supported by the Dynamics 365 Business Central product group in Microsoft. You are welcome to use and build upon bc2adls, however, you are doing so at your own risk.
As we are only a small group, our support on this tool is very limited. Please expect delays in responding to your queries or bugs. 
If the product group releases an officially supported data export feature, bc2adls will be deprecated. In that case, we will update this page to reflect this. 

## How to file issues and get help  

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing 
issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates.  For new issues, file your bug or 
feature request as a new Issue. As this is a Github project, a self-service approach is encouraged. Feel free to create pull requests with your changes.

## Microsoft Support Policy
