# Support

Please be aware that this tool is an experiment and should not be used for running Extract- Transform- Load data processes from Dynamics 365 Business Central. The tool is not supported by the product group in Microsoft and was created with the sole intention of inspiring the community. Because of the paucity of resources, our support on this tool is very limited. The tool will be obsoleted if and once the data export feature is supported by the product group. Please expect delays in responding to your queries or bugs.
